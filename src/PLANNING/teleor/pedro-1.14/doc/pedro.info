1 Introduction
**************

Pedro is a subscription/notification system based on Prolog technology.
The main component of the system is the Pedro server that is responsible
for managing subscriptions from clients and for forwarding client
notifications to clients with matching subscriptions.

   From the clients point of view subscriptions and notifications are
strings that represent Prolog terms.  The server parses these strings
into Prolog terms and treats subscriptions in a similar way to Prolog
clauses and notifications in a similar way to Prolog queries to be
matched against subscriptions.

   Readers unfamiliar with Prolog are referred to the following books.

   * Prolog Programming for Artificial Intelligence, Bratko
   * The Art of Prolog, Sterling and Shapiro
   * Programming in Prolog, Clocksin and Mellish
   * Techniques of Prolog Programming, Van Lee

2 Running Pedro
***************

Pedro is a daemon and is started using the following command.

   'pedro [OPTIONS..]'

   Using the help option '-?' produces the following output.

Usage:
  pedro [OPTION...] 

Help Options:
  -?, --help                Show help options

Application Options:
  --version                 Show version
  -P, --Port=p              Use port p for connecting (default 4550)
  -S, --Size                The size for various areas (default 1024)
  -L, --Logfile=logfile     Use logfile for logging
  -A, --Admin=admin_machine Use admin_machine for receiving all messages

   If no log file is supplied then '/dev/null' is used.  If 'stdout' is
used for the log file then Pedro will not be a daemon and the log
information will be written to standard output.

   If an admin machine is supplied then a process registering the name
'admin' on that machine will receive all message including peer-to-peer
messages between other processes.

   Otherwise the supplied log file must be writable by the caller.

3 Syntax
********

In this section we describe the syntax of the Prolog terms that are used
for both subscriptions and notifications.  The syntax we use is standard
Prolog syntax with a cut-down set of the built-in prefix and infix
operators.

3.1 Numbers
===========

Pedro numbers are 32 bit integers in decimal notation and floating point
numbers in decimal and scientific notation.

   Examples:
     Integers: 42, -100
     Doubles: 3.14, -1.3e-5


File: pedro.info,  Node: Atoms,  Next: Strings,  Prev: Numbers,  Up: Syntax

3.2 Atoms
=========

The syntax of Pedro atoms fall into four categories:
  1. A lower case letter followed by any sequence consisting of "_" and
     alphanumeric characters.

     Examples:
          fred, a12, this_is_an_ATOM

  2. Any combination of the following set of graphic characters.
          -/+*<=>#@$\^&~`:.?
     Examples:
          ==>, :?, -:-

  3. Any sequence of characters enclosed by single quotes.  The
     character "\" indicates an escape sequence.

     Examples:
          'Fred', 'it\'s', '\n'

  4. ';' '[]' and the open-close parenthesis pair


File: pedro.info,  Node: Strings,  Next: Variables,  Prev: Atoms,  Up: Syntax

3.3 Strings
===========

Pedro strings are sequences of characters enclosed by double quotes.  As
with quoted atoms, the character "\" indicates an escape sequence.

   Examples:
     "This is a string", "A string with a ', a \" and a newline \n"


File: pedro.info,  Node: Variables,  Next: Compound Terms,  Prev: Strings,  Up: Syntax

3.4 Variables
=============

The syntax of Pedro variables fall into two categories.
  1. An upper case letter or "_" followed by any sequence consisting of
     "_" and alphanumeric characters.

     Examples:
          X, X_23, _fred_12
  2. The "anonymous" variable "_"

   Note that repeated occurrences of a variable token of the first
category in a string representing a Pedro term represent the same
variable.  This is not the case for anonymous variables: each occurrence
represents a different variable.


File: pedro.info,  Node: Compound Terms,  Next: Lists,  Prev: Variables,  Up: Syntax

3.5 Compound Terms
==================

The syntax of a compound Pedro term consists of an atom token (the
functor) followed by an opening bracket followed by a comma separated
list of syntax representing Pedro terms (the arguments) followed by a
closing bracket.

   A compound term must have at least one argument.  The arity of a
compound term is the number of arguments.

   Examples:
     f(a), g(Var, "string", 42, h(a, g(b)))


File: pedro.info,  Node: Lists,  Next: Operators,  Prev: Compound Terms,  Up: Syntax

3.6 Lists
=========

The atom '[]' represents the empty list.

   The syntax of a non-empty Pedro list consists of an opening square
bracket followed by a comma separated list of syntax representing Pedro
terms (optionally followed by a "|" followed by syntax representing
Pedro term) followed by a closing square bracket.

   Examples:
     [], [V, a, f(2), [a,b,c], "string'], [H1, H2|T]

   The list syntax involving "|" is typically used to describe list
patterns.  For example, the third example above might be used to match
against lists with at least two elements ('H1' and 'H2') and whose tail
is 'T'.


File: pedro.info,  Node: Operators,  Prev: Lists,  Up: Syntax

3.7 Operators
=============

Below is the table of operators used in Pedro.  The table lists the
declarations of the operators as used in Prolog.  In Prolog, the
declaration 'op(Prec, Assoc, Ops)' declares the list of operators 'Ops'
to have precedence 'Pred' and associativity 'Assoc'.  The smaller the
precedence, the more tightly the operator binds.  For the associativity
argument 'xfy' describes a right-associative infix operator, 'xfx'
describes a non-associative infix operator, 'yfx' describes a
left-associative infix operator, and 'fy' describes an associative
prefix operator.

     op(1100, xfy, [ ; ]).
     op(1050, xfy, [ -> ]).
     op(1000, xfy, [ ',' ]).
     op(700, xfx, [ = , is, < , =< , > , >= ]).
     op(500, yfx, [ + , - , /\ , \/ ]).
     op(400, yfx, [ * , / , // , rem , mod , << , >> ]).
     op(200, xfx, [ ** ]).
     op(200, fy, [ + , - ]).
     op(100, xfx, [ @ ]).
     op(50, xfx, [ : ]). 

   Examples:
     The string "X is A + - B + C*D" parses to the term is(X, +(+(A, -(B)), *(C, D)))
     The string "G1 -> G2 ; G3" parses to the term ;(->(G1, G2), G3)

   Note that comma is used both as an argument separator and as an infix
operator.  Each operator used at the top-level of an argument of a list
or compound term has to have precedence less than 1000.  If an argument
has an operator of higher precedence then the argument needs to be
enclosed in brackets.

   Examples:
     The string "f((G1, G2))" parses to the compound term f(','(G1, G2))
     The string "[G, (G1;G2)]" parses to the list [G, ;(G1, G2)]


File: pedro.info,  Node: Notifications,  Next: Subscriptions,  Prev: Syntax,  Up: Top

4 Notifications
***************

Notifications are newline terminated strings sent from clients to the
Pedro server.  A valid notification is a string that represents an atom,
a list or a compound Pedro term (with a following newline).  The Pedro
server reads characters from a client until it gets a newline.  The
server will then attempt to parse the characters up to (but not
including) the newline as a compound Pedro term.  If this succeeds then
the server processes the notification term; otherwise the string is
ignored.

   Examples (trailing newline removed):
     Valid:
     info(fred, 42, "some string")

     Invalid (not compound, atom or list):
     "bad"
     X

     Invalid (does not parse):
     f(a;b)
     f([a,b))

   The server will acknowledge the client with a 1 if the notification
is valid and a 0 otherwise.


File: pedro.info,  Node: Subscriptions,  Next: Removing Subscriptions,  Prev: Notifications,  Up: Top

5 Subscriptions
***************

Like notifications, subscriptions are newline terminated strings that
parse as compound Pedro terms.  The functor of each subscription term is
always 'subscribe' and has arity 3.  In other words, each subscription
term is of the form 'subscribe('Head', 'Body', 'Rock')'.  Following the
similarity between subscriptions and Prolog clauses we refer to the
first argument as the head of the subscription and the second argument
as the body of the subscription.

   The third argument is commonly referred to as a rock.  This is an
integer and its meaning is determined by each client.  When the Pedro
server matches a notification against the subscription, the server sends
the notification string together with the rock to the subscribing
client.  A given client can use the rock to, for example, refer to a
message queue or a thread and thereby determine how to process the
notification.

   The Pedro server will match a notification against a subscription if
the notification term unifies with the head of the subscription and,
with this unifier, the goal in the body of the subscription is
satisfied.  Readers are referred to Prolog references for descriptions
of unification, variable binding, dereferencing, occurs check,
backtracking and goal evaluation.

   When the server matches a notification against a subscription it will
send the string consisting of the subscribers rock followed by a space
followed by the notification string (including the newline).

   The server will acknowledge an attempt by a client to subscribe with
a string consisting of an integer (an ID) followed by a newline.  The ID
will be 0 if the subscription attempt fails (the string is too long, it
doesn't parse, or does not represent a valid subscription term).  If the
subscription attempt succeeds then the ID will be a unique (for that
client) positive integer.  This ID is used when the client chooses to
unsubscribe.

   The following table lists the "basic" valid subscription goals and
their semantics that can be used in the body of subscriptions.  As with
Prolog, whenever a unification is carried out, the variable bindings
implied by the unifier are applied.

   Note that, unlike most Prologs, unification in Pedro uses the occurs
check.

'true'
     Always succeeds

'fail'
     Always fails

'T1 = T2'
     Succeeds if and only if the terms 'T1' and 'T2' unify.

'T1 is T2'
     Succeeds if and only if 'T1' unifies with the evaluation of the the
     arithmetic expression 'T2'.  The goal produces a type error if 'T2'
     does not represent an arithmetic expression that can be fully
     evaluated (to a number).  The valid arithmetic expressions are
     described later.

'T1 < T2'
     Succeeds if and only if the arithmetic expression 'T1' evaluates to
     a number that is less than the evaluation of the arithmetic
     expression 'T2'.  The goal produces a type error if either term
     does not represent an arithmetic expression that can be fully
     evaluated (to a number).

'T1 =< T2'
     The same as above, except that a less-or-equal test is applied.

'T1 > T2'
     The same as above, except that a greater-than test is applied.

'T1 >= T2'
     The same as above, except that a greater-or-equal test is applied.

'member(X, L)'
     Succeeds if and only if 'L' is a "cons" pair and 'X' unifies with
     the head element of 'L' or 'X' is a member of the tail of 'L'.

'split(L1, L2, L3)'
     Succeeds if and only if the concatenation of the lists 'L2' and
     'L3' unifies with 'L1'.  The list 'L1' must be supplied.

'splitstring(S1, S2, S3)'
     Succeeds if and only if the concatenation of the strings 'S2' and
     'S3' unifies with 'S1'.  The string 'S1' must be supplied.

'number(T)'
     Succeeds if and only if 'T' is a number.

'atom(T)'
     Succeeds if and only if 'T' is an atom.

'string(T)'
     Succeeds if and only if 'T' is a string.

'list(T)'
     Succeeds if and only if 'T' is either the empty list or a "cons"
     pair.

   The following table lists the valid meta-level subscription goals -
i.e.  goals that take valid goals as arguments.

'G1 , G2'
     Conjunction: succeeds if and only if first the goal 'G1' succeeds
     and then the goal 'G2' succeeds.

'G1 ; G2'
     Disjunction: succeeds if and only if either the goal 'G1' succeed
     or the goal 'G2' succeeds.

'G1 -> G2 ; G3'
     If-then-else: If 'G1' succeeds then alternative solutions for 'G1'
     are removed and the goal succeeds if and only if 'G2' succeeds.
     Otherwise, the goal succeeds if and only if 'G3' succeeds.

'not(G)'
     Negation: succeeds if and only if 'G' fails.  In Prolog this form
     of negations is called "unsafe negation".

'once(G)'
     Succeeds if and only if 'G' succeeds.  Alternative solutions are
     removed.

   The following are valid arithmetic expressions.  Numbers are valid
arithmetic expressions and in the table below, 'E1' and 'E2' are valid
arithmetic expressions.

'pi'
     Pi
'e'
     E
'- E1'
     Negation
'E1 + E2'
     Addition
'E1 - E2'
     Subtraction
'E1 * E2'
     Multiplication
'E1 / E2'
     Division
'E1 // E2'
     Integer division
'E1 ** E2'
     Exponentiation
'E1 rem E2'
     Remainder ('E1' and 'E2' are integer expressions)
'E1 mod E2'
     Modulo ('E1' and 'E2' are integer expressions)
'E1 /\ E2'
     Bitwise And ('E1' and 'E2' are integer expressions)
'E1 \/ E2'
     Bitwise Or ('E1' and 'E2' are integer expressions)
'\E1'
     Bitwise Negation ('E1' is an integer expression)
'E1 << E2'
     Shift Left ('E1' and 'E2' are integer expressions)
'E1 >> E2'
     Shift Right ('E1' and 'E2' are integer expressions)
'abs(E1)'
     Absolute Value
'round(E1)'
     Round
'floor(E1)'
     Floor
'ceiling(E1)'
     Ceiling
'sqrt(E1)'
     Square Root
'sin(E1)'
     Sin
'cos(E1)'
     Cos
'tan(E1)'
     Tan
'asin(E1)'
     Arcsin
'acos(E1)'
     Arccos
'atan(E1)'
     Arctan
'log(E1)'
     Log (base e)

   The following are examples of valid subscriptions.  In all these
examples, the rock is zero but can be any integer (e.g.  thread ID).

   * 'subscribe(info(fred, X), true, 0)' : in this example, the goal is
     'true' and will always succeed.  Hence, this subscription will
     match against any notification the unifies with the head term -
     i.e.  any compound term whose functor is 'info', has arity 2 and
     has first argument 'fred'

   * 'subscribe(data(L), (member(height = H, L), H > 1000), 0)' : the
     head of this subscription matches against any notification with
     functor 'data' and arity 1.  The subscription will match a
     notification if the notifications argument is a list that contains
     a term of the form 'height = H' and 'H' is a number greater than
     1000.  Note that, as with Prolog, operators can be used to build
     terms (even when the operator semantics is not being used).  In
     this case the operator '=' is just a convenient infix operator used
     to construct an arity 2 compound term.

   * 'subscribe(foo(X, X), (X < 10; X > 20), 0)' : the head matches
     against any notification with functor 'foo', has arity 2, and whose
     arguments are unifiable.  The body succeeds if 'X' is either less
     than 10 or greater then 20.

   * 'subscribe(str(S), (splitstring(S, _, S2), splitstring(S2, "hello",
     _)), 0)': this subscription matches any notification with functor
     'str' and arity 1 and whose argument is a string containing
     '"hello"' as a substring.

   * 'subscribe(foo(X, Y), (atom(X) -> number(Y), Y > 0 ; atom(Y)), 0)':
     this subscription matches any notification with functor 'foo', has
     arity 2, and if its first argument ('X') is an atom then 'Y' is a
     number greater then 0, else 'Y' is an atom.

   The following example illustrates what happens when type errors occur
in an attempted match of a subscription and a notification.

   Consider the subscription

   'subscribe(foo(X, Y), (X < 0 -> Y > 10 ; Y < 10), 0)'

   and the notification

   'foo(bar, 0)'

   In this case the head of the subscription matches the notification
but 'X' is not a number and so the test 'X < 0' produces a type error
which causes the attempted match to fail.

   If the intention of the subscription was to test if X is a number
less than 0 then it should be written as follows.

   'subscribe(foo(X, Y), (number(X), X < 0 -> Y > 10 ; Y < 10), 0)'

   In this case the notification above will match.

6 Removing Subscriptions
************************

A client can remove a subscription by sending the newline terminated
string 'unsubscribe(ID)' to the server, where 'ID' is the ID of the
subscription to be removed.  Recall the when a client makes a
subscription, the server returns a client-unique ID for the
subscription.  It is this ID that is used to remove the subscription.

   It is the clients responsibility to keep track of the mapping between
subscriptions and IDs.

   The server will acknowledge the client with a 1 if the unsubscription
succeeds and a 0 otherwise.


File: pedro.info,  Node: Registrations,  Next: Removing Registrations,  Prev: Removing Subscriptions,  Up: Top

7 Registrations
***************

A client can register a name with the Pedro server.  This name can be
used by other registered clients to provide peer-to-peer communication.
This is done by sending the following string (with a newline
termination) to the Pedro server (where 'name' is the name being
registered).

   'register(name)'

   The registered name must be an atom not containing the characters
'','', '':'' and ''@''.

   The server will acknowledge the client with a 1 if the registration
succeeds and a 0 otherwise.

   Semantically, a registration is the same as a restricted form of
subscription.  Specifically, a registration can be thought of as a
subscription of the following form.

   'subscribe(p2pmsg(_:name@machine, _, _), true, 0)'

   where 'name' is the name being registered (the name of this process)
and 'machine' is the name of the machine on which the process is
running.  The restriction is that at most one process on any given
machine can register a given name.

   The idea is that a notification of the form

   'p2pmsg(ToAddr, MyAddr, Msg)'

   where 'ToAddr' and 'MyAddr' are addresses of the form
'ID:Name@Machine' will match a registration subscription if the 'ToAddr'
of the notification unifies with the first argument of the subscription.

   The 'ID' part of an address is optional and is ignored by the Pedro
server.  It is up to the clients to determine how this argument is used.
This might be, for example, used as the name of a thread or message
queue.  The rock used when sending such notifications to clients is
always set to '0'.

   The ID part of an address can be elided from the notification if it
is not required.  It is up to the clients to determine what to do if no
ID is supplied.

   The 'Name' and 'Machine' parts of 'ToAddr' are either atoms or
variables.  The characters '','', '':'' and ''@'' are not allowed to
appear in 'Name' or 'Machine'.  It is also possible for 'ToAddr' to be a
variable in which case the semantics is the same as having an address
with both 'Name' and 'Machine' variables.

   If 'Name' is a variable then the notification will be sent to all
registered processes on that machine.  If 'Machine' is a variable then
the notification will be sent to all processes with that registered
name.  If both are variables then the notification will be sent to all
registered processes on all machines that have registered processes.

   Note that 'MyAddr' can be any valid address, but in practice the
client should make sure that this is its address.  It will typically be
used by the receiving client when responding to a message.

   Example:

   The notification 'p2pmsg(foo@'foo.com.au', bar@'bar.com.au',
info(fred, [1,2,3]))' is intended for the process with registered name
'foo' on ''foo.com.au'' (note that the process name and machine name
must both be atoms).  This client is registered with the name 'bar'.

8 Removing Registrations
************************

Registrations are removed by sending a newline terminated string of the
form

   'deregister(name)'

   where 'name' is the registered name of the process.

   The server will acknowledge the client with a 1 if the deregistration
succeeds and a 0 otherwise.

9 Connecting to Pedro
*********************

The communication between each client and the Pedro server is via a pair
of sockets.  One is used for two-way data transfer (e.g.  notifications,
subscriptions), the other is used for the server to acknowledge messages
from the client.  This will be a '0' for invalid data from the client
and non-zero for valid data.

   The creation of the two sockets is done as follows.  Examples are
given in the code for the Python and Java APIs.

  1. Create a socket in the client (this will be used to obtain
     information from the server)

  2. Use 'connect' to connect the socket to the Pedro server.  Pedro
     will be listening for the connection on a given port.  The default
     port is 4550.

  3. Read an IP address and two ports (sent by the server as a newline
     terminated string).  The IP address is to be used for the
     connection to the server.  The two ports are for connecting two
     sockets (for acknowledgements and for data).

  4. Close the socket.

  5. Create a socket in the client (this will be used for
     acknowledgements).

  6. Use 'connect' to connect the socket to the Pedro server for
     acknowledgements.  Pedro will be listening for the connection on
     the first of the two ports send by the server.

  7. Read the client ID on this socket (sent by the server as a newline
     terminated string).

  8. Create another socket in the client (this will be used for data).

  9. Use 'connect' to connect the socket to the Pedro server for data.
     Pedro will be listening for the connection on the second of the two
     ports send by the server.

  10. Send the client the client ID on the data socket (the same string
     the server sent above).

  11. Read the status on the data socket.  If the connection succeeds
     the status will be the string '"ok\n"'.

10 Denial of Service
********************

Pedro's was designed as a message transport for communicating agents,
typically in a local area network.  It was not designed to deal with
security issues relating to open networks.  Even so, Pedro needs to take
into account various DOS issues because client programs can have bugs
and may block in ways that might cause problems for the Pedro server.

   Consequently, the Pedro server is designed to overcome various
problems caused by badly behaving clients.

   Firstly, the length of any newline terminated string sent to the
server has to be less than a bound that can be set using the '-S' switch
at startup.  The default is 1024.  If the server does not find a newline
(from a given client) before it reaches the bound then that string will
be ignored.

   Secondly, in Prolog, there are many ways to create infinite
computation, either by constructing infinite (cyclic) terms and then
processing them or by calling other non-terminating goals.  Because
Pedro uses occurs checking within unification then infinite terms cannot
be constructed.  Also, the valid goals used in subscriptions cannot
produce infinite computation.

   Thirdly, when a client disconnects, all its subscriptions are
automatically removed.

   Finally, there is the issue of blocking in the Pedro server.  Because
Pedro was designed to support communicating agents then we need to
guarantee that messages from a given client will be processed in the
order sent and that no messages will be dropped.

   Consider a client that has subscribed but does not read notifications
sent to it.  Eventually, the Pedro server will not be able to send any
more notifications to this client and so will have to block on any
notifications that this client should receive.  This may then cause
notifying clients to block.  To avoid this problem the Pedro server
attaches a timeout to clients that causes the Pedro server to block.
When the timeout expires (without the client consuming more
notifications), the client is disconnected and all its subscriptions
removed.  The timeout is currently set to 1 second.

   Consequently, when writing a client program, it would be best to
consume notifications as soon as they arrive.

   This timeout is also used when a client is trying to connect.  If the
handshake is not completed within this time, the client will be
disconnected.

   Note that, although dealing with open networks was not a design
concern for Pedro, we believe the above defenses against DOS would allow
Pedro to work in such environments.

11 Library
**********

The Pedro C-library provides support for writing Pedro clients.  It is
built on top of the glib library.

   'Client' is an opaque datatype used to store information about a
Pedro client.  The intention is to use 'g_main_loop_run' with the
callback declared in the creation of the client called each time data is
sent to the client from the Pedro server.  The program 'consumer.c' in
the examples directory is a simple example using this approach.

   The following functions define the client interface.

'Client* client_new(void (*cb) (char*, gpointer, gpointer), gpointer user_data);'
     This function returns a pointer to a new client object connected to
     the Pedro server on this machine using the default port (4550).
     The callback 'cb' (user defined) takes the data from the server,
     the rock specified in the matching subscription and a pointer to
     user data and is called each time data arrives from the server.
     The last argument, 'user_data', is a pointer to the user data used
     as the third agument to the callback.

'Client* client_new_full(int port, char* hostname, void (*cb) (char*, gpointer, gpointer), gpointer user_data);'
     This function is the same as the previous one except the port and
     machine name of the Pedro server are also supplied.

'void client_destroy(Client* client);'
     Shut down the connection with the Pedro server and free the client
     object data.

'int subscribe(Client* client, char* term, char* goal, gpointer rock);'
     Make a subscription for the given client and return the ID of the
     subscription (0 if the subscription is unsuccessful).

'gboolean unsubscribe(Client* client, guint id);'
     Remove the subscription with the supplied ID. It returns true iff
     the operation was successful.

'gboolean notify(Client* client, char* term);'
     Send a notification to the server.  It returns true iff the
     operation was successful.

'gboolean register_name(Client* client, char* name);'
     Register the supplied name with the server.  It returns true iff
     the operation was successful.

'gboolean deregister_name(Client* client);'
     Deregister the current name with the server.  It returns true iff
     the operation was successful.

'gboolean p2p(Client* client, char* toaddr, char* msg);'
     Send a peer-to-peer message to the supplied address.  It returns
     true iff the operation was successful.

The directories 'src/c_api', 'src/python_api' and 'src/java_api' contain
APIs for C, Python and Java.

File: pedro.info,  Node: C API,  Next: Python API,  Up: APIs

12.1 C API
==========

The directory 'src/c_api' contains a C-level API for Pedro clients (not
using glib) in the files 'c_api.c', 'c_api.h', 'pedro_token.c' and
'pedro_token.h'.

   The directory also contains four example programs in two pairs.  The
program 'producer.c' sends notifications entered by the user.  The
program 'consumer.c' subscribes based on information entered by the user
and displays received notifications.

   The programs 'ping.c' and 'pong.c' respectively registers the names
'ping' and 'pong'.  The program 'ping.c' repeatedly asks for a term from
the user, sends it as a peer-to-peer message to 'pong' and waits for a
reply message and displays it.  The program 'pong.c' repeatedly waits
for a peer-to-peer message, and replies with the same message wrapped in
a structured term whose functor is 'echo'.

   The file 'c_api.h' contains comments describing the API.srsrc


File: pedro.info,  Node: Python API,  Next: Java API,  Prev: C API,  Up: APIs

12.2 Python API
===============

The directory 'src/python_api' contains a definition for a Pedro client
class in the file 'pedroclient.py'.  This directory also contains a
program 'pedro_gui.py' that uses this API and provides an interface to
subscriptions and notifications.

   Below is a simple example using this class withing the python
interpreter.

>>> from pedroclient import *
>>> me = PedroClient()
>>> me.subscribe('f(X)')
1
>>> me.notify('f(a)')
1
>>> me.get_notification()
('f(a)', 0)
>>> me.notify('f(g(12, "hi"))')
1
>>> print me.get_term()[0]
f(g(12, "hi"))
>>> 

'PedroClient(machine='localhost', port=4550, async = True)'
     Create a Pedro client object connected to the Pedro server on
     'hostname' using the port 'port'.  If 'async' is true a thread is
     created to process Pedro messages.  If not, a call to
     'notification_ready' will process any Pedro messages.  If the main
     program has its own event loop (e.g.  in pygame) then the program
     runs faster setting 'async' to 'False' and adding
     'notification_ready' to the loop.

'disconnect()'
     A method that disconnects the client.

'connect()'
     A method that (re)connects the client.

'notify(term)'
     A method that sends 'term' as a notification to the Pedro server.

'subscribe(term, goal = 'true', rock = 0)'
     A method that subscribes with the supplied term, goal and rock.
     This method, if successful, returns the ID of the subscription.

'unsubscribe(ID)'
     A method that unsubscribes to the subscription with the given ID.

'register(name)'
     A method that registers the supplied name with the Pedro server.

'deregister()'
     A method that deregisters its name.

'p2p(toaddr, term)'
     A method that sends 'term' to the address 'toaddr' using the
     peer-to-peer support.  The machine part of the address can be
     elided if it is to a process on the same machine.  Do not use
     'localhost' as the name of the machine.

'get_notification()'
     A method that returns the next notification received by the client
     as a pair consiting of the notification string together with the
     rock supplied in the corresponding subscription.  This method
     blocks until a message is available if 'async == True' and returns
     'None' if 'async == false' .

'get_term()'
     This has the same behaviour as 'get_notification' except that the
     notification is parsed into a Prolog term.

'parse_string(string)'
     Parse 'string' into a Prolog term.

'notification_ready()'
     A method that tests if a notification is ready to get.

'PedroParser()'
     Create a Prolog parser object.  The only method, 'parse(string)',
     parses 'string' to a Prolog term.  If a parse error occurs, a
     'ParserError' exception is thrown that contains the position of the
     error.


File: pedro.info,  Node: Java API,  Prev: Python API,  Up: APIs

12.3 Java API
=============

The directory 'src/java_api' contains a definition for a Pedro client
class and support for Prolog terms (including a Prolog parser).

   The file 'Client.java' contains a very simple program that connects
to the Pedro server, makes a subscription based on the runtime
arguments, and enters a loop that parses the received notification into
Prolog terms then pretty prints them.

   The Pedro client object creation and methods are the same as in the
Python case from the previous section except there is no 'get_term'
method.  This is replaced by the use of a parser that converts strings
(from a call to 'get_notification()') to a Prolog term.

   The files 'PedroEvent.java' and 'PedroListener.java' provide support
for data events from the Pedro server.  Clients can add listeners to
data events using the 'addPedroListener' method.  The file
'PedroGUI.java' is similar to 'pedro_gui.py' and contains an example of
using this method.

A.1 GNU Free Documentation License
==================================

                      Version 1.2, November 2002

     Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
     so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
