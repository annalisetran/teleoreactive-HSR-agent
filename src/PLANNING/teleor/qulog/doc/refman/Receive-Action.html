<p>When a blocking <code>receive</code> is executed by a QuLog thread the message buffer  of the thread is searched from the oldest message to the most recent to see if there is a message term 
that is an instance of  one of the message patterns from a sender with handle that  is an instance of address patterns. The receive patterns are tried in their given before/after order.
 If a message is found that satisfies the two constraints 
of the <i>i</i>th rule it is removed, the <i>Acti</i> simple action sequence is executed and the receive is exited. Should the end message buffer be reached with no acceptable message found the thread will suspend until a new message arrives.  Each new message is tested for acceptability. If there is a <code>timeout</code> rule 
 this will be fired when  <i>T</i> seconds have elapsed since the thread started its search for an acceptable message.
 <i>DefaultAct</i> is executed and the <code>receive</code> is exited. If there is no <code>timeout</code> rule the receive action will block indefinitely waiting for an acceptable message.
