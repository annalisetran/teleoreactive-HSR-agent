The first step is to install Qu-Prolog and Pedro. Both can be obtained from
http://staff.itee.uq.edu.au/pjr/

Qu-Prolog is required because qulog is implemented in Qu-Prolog.

Pedro is needed because qulog (and in particular TR programs) use Pedro 
communication. The Pedro server needs to be running to use Pedro communication 
between processes.

The second step is to build the qulog interpreter by running 
./configure
make

The file PROFILE_CMDS contains details of how to modify your PATH
so that you can run the various programs in the bin directory without having 
to give the path.

The system contains the following directories:

doc: Various pdfs of documentation.

bin: Various Qulog related programs. This includes quled which is a simple
Python based editor for Qulog and Teleor programs that use indentation and
syntax highlighting in a similar way to that using the emacs mode.

emacs: An emacs mode for Qulog

examples: Various examples of using the Qulog interpreter and for running
          TR programs

src: The source for Qulog
