Embedded agents are designed to be used in situations where the sensors
and controls are more easily managed directly by the running process.
This is the case for the EV3, for example. In the ev3 subdirectory we provide
an interface to the ev3 sensors and motor controls and use that to code a
simple TR program that reacts to its touch sensors being touched.

In this directory we provide a simplifed version of the ev3 TR program that
simply responds to belief store updates by the user by displaying the controls.
