This program is a simple interactive natural deduction prover.

The main aims of this example is to:

1. show how "nondeterministic actions" can be used by escaping to the Prolog
   level.

2. how the programmer can use application specific operators using Prolog
   level op declarations in conjunction with read_op_term and write_op_term.

The file are:

op_decl.ql  -  the Prolog-level operator declarations
natural_deduction.qlg  -  the interactive natural deduction prover.
natural_deduction_support.ql - the Prolog level code that implements
   nondeterministic actions
