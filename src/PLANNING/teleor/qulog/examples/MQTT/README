The file mqtt_pedro.c is an MQTT equivalent for providing an interface between
Teleor agents and the robot side.

We have included the required source code for the
[Eclipse Paho](http://eclipse.org/paho) MQTT C client library.

To run start up 3 terminals and :

1. In terminal 1
   ./mqtt_pedro

2. In terminal 2
   mqtt_robot_shell.py
   
3. In terminal 3
   agent_shell.py agent robo

Now in agent_shell enter some action terms - e.g. move(1), turn(left)
and you should see that displayed in terminal 1 and in mqtt_robot_shell

In mqtt_robot_shell enter some percepts  - e.g.
see(bottle, left, 10), see(depot, centre, 5)
