The file ros_pedro.cc contains a template example of how Teleor agents can
interact with a ROS robot.

The Teleor agent uses Pedro for receiving percepts from the robot side and it
sends Pedro messages containing agent actions to the robot.

The ROS-Pedro interface is responsible for:
1. responding to an initialise_ message by sending back an initial list of
   percepts using either the 'all' or 'updates' interface

2. converting agent action messages from the agent into controls for driving
   motor, arms, etc.

3. converting low-level sensor information into high-level percepts that are
   sent to the agent via Pedro using the  'all' or 'updates' interface.


client_api.c comes from the Pedro release and is included for convenience.

To run start up 3 terminals and :

1. In terminal 1
   ./ros_pedro

2. In terminal 2
   ros_robot_shell.py
   
3. In terminal 3
   agent_shell.py agent robo

Now in agent_shell enter some action terms - e.g. move(1), turn(left)
and you should see that displayed in terminal 1 and in ros_robot_shell

In ros_robot_shell enter some percepts  - e.g.
see(bottle, left, 10), see(depot, centre, 5)
