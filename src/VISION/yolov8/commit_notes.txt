tracker.launch
- modify topic names for input and output topics

tracker_node.py
- modify topic names for input and output topics
- improve occlusion detection to use any part of bounding box overlapping instead of corners

plotter.py
- add feature to plot skeleton and bounding box of person and head. Can pass flag to toggle what to display.

19/09/2024
plotter.py
- add new function plot_object_and_skeleton

tracker_node.py
- call plot_object_and_skeleton to draw the new skeleton and plot_object_and_skeleton

tracker.launch
- update parameters
  - iou_thres = 0.30
  - mask_expansion_pc = 0.02

15/09/2024
tracker_node
- modify coocluded thresholds
- add occlusion for head against other person bbox
- improve occlusion checking using a map
tracker.launch
- modify mask_expansion_pct

08/09/2024
tracker_node.py
- align head with person skeleton
  - reorder the way person is processed
- add vertical occlusion checking

plotter.py
- fix head plotting when touching edges

.gitignore
- add scripts/__pycache__/ to ignore vscode python cache files

04/09/2024
tracker_node.py
- the following change has been tested
- increase the bbox size on person by the threshold(the bbox in msg does not change but only increase the one used for masking image), so that it maintains more skeltons and body features when crop too tight.
tracker.launch
- add param to support the change above. It is a percentage in relation to original image size.


27/08/2024
tracker_node.py
- add distance calculation(in 2d, relavent to the base link. Height of the object position is ignored)
- add occulusion check for person and person head
- add a sleep in init to make sure tf is catch up
- increase the timeout for tf a little bit to decrease the chance of not getting tf and drop frame 
- add a rospy.gettime() at the beginning so easier to other print statement in the middle to determine performance for debug purpose

traker.launch
- change some params for testing on the physical robot instead of bag file

tracking_id_handler.py
- remove the print statement

plotter.py
- add distance and occluded(turning red for bounding box edge)
26/08/2024
plotter.py
- adjust font and size and round confidence

23/08/2024
tracker_node.py
- instead of checbking conf score for skelton. Check its position being 0,0 because any skelton below thresh is set to 00
- add offset so skelton in msg is correct
20/08/2024
tracker_node.py
- remove some rospy.loginfo
- add check for invalid skelton(0,0,0) to make sure it is definitely not transform into 3d points
tracking_id_handler.py
- add resetting not seen when object track gets redetected(implemented for both object and person tracking).
custom_bytetturack.yaml
- tune parameters.
19/08/2024
tracker_node.py
- remove print statement
- add the custom tracking for person
tracking_id_handler.py
- implement the logic for it
custom_bytetrack.yaml
- change some params

17/08/2024
tracker_node.py
- fix the issue "local variable 'bbox3d' referenced before assignment" while 3d is off, by init it to be None
tracker.launch
- add threshold confidence score for bp detection
- false association never happens when people crossing each other unless near edges
- can be further tune to stop id switching on the same person.
- I got ideas of what most of the config param is.
15/08/2024
tracker_node.py
- update to use the latest msg
- use a genrealised appraoch so can use a boolean in launchfile to indicate if we want to populate 3d msgs
- everything in msg is populated in 3d mode, except for distance, need further discuss if needed 
tracker_node_2d.py 
- populate skeleton2d instead of skeleton

tracker.launch
- use arg for bp model
14/08/2024
tracker_conf\custom_bytetrack.yaml
 - create custom tracker playing with parameters to get better tracking ids, less false associations

tracker_2d.launch
- change some parameters
